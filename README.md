Content Summary

# Introduction to the project on Diabetes Prediction.

# Problem Statement and Solution Overview:

Problem Statement: The goal is to develop a predictive model for diabetes based on health metrics.

Solution Overview: The solution involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training multiple machine learning models.

# Data Overview:

Description of the dataset, including key health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

Explanation of the target variable, which indicates whether an individual has diabetes.

# Solution Approach:

# Steps in the solution process, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.

Feature Scaling: Normalizing the data to improve model performance.

Model Training: Implementing and comparing multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).

# Model Evaluation:

Evaluation criteria such as accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and other metrics.

Selection of the final model based on a balance between accuracy and interpretability.

# Conclusion and Future Work:

Summary of findings and potential next steps for improving the model.

# How to Use
